 ## Rationale
 
-As most developers do, I've started this project after becoming really frustrated with an existing solution: mongoose. Mongoose repo is now at over 300 issues reported, many of them go stale and unresolved. That aside, here are the main reasons I wanted to get away from Mongoose:
+This project is a lightweight alternative to Mongoose. The main reasons are:
 
 - breaking changes are not always documented, I had to find on my own, for example, that aliases don't work automatically anymore, after upgrading from v5 to v6.
-- it has become incredibly easy to corrupt my data using mongoose; things like `deleteMany(filter)` actually deleting all data; things like `update(filter, cmd)` updating all documents, not just the ones in the filter, because the contributors have decided to go against MongoDB and apply commands to ALL documents when a field does not exist in the schema (mongo will apply to NONE).

Note: this may be solved soon, from what I've read.
 - it has become quite difficult to debug a mongoose project, mainly due to its model of overwriting every single mongo native command
-- you cannot make anything serious using mongoose without eventually calling native driver functions, which then makes me wonder why do we even want to use mongoose?
 - mongoose is a huge project, an empty project with `npm i mongoose` quickly arrives at 14 MB (out of which mongoDB is 9.5MB)
 - I am a strong believer in the "single responsibility" paradigm, "do one thing and do it well". You need data validation? Install a data validation library. You need aliased fields? Install an alias translator (this package). You need virtual fields? Install a virtual field provider. And so on.
 - And finally, and perhaps most importantly, MongoDB driver commands should have never been overridden in this way. It makes it a lot harder to keep mongoose in sync with MongoDB evolution, prevents the devs from using mongoDB as intended by 10gen, and creates a lot of confusion and mistrust towards this wonderful database system. (have you heard people complaining that mongoDB corrupted their data? It's most likely not MongoDB).
